# Synamic Development Time Docs
 Docs in this directory are not library reference/manual, tutorial or anything like that.
 
 These docs are my (Md. Sabuj Sarker @SabujXi) thoughts, plans, TO-DOs, change logs, etc.
 Also keep in mind that these docs are also not well updated when I have completed something or in the middle of doing something.
 I will create user docs for Synamic when the first alpha or beta or release candidate is complete.
 
 Keep patience, everything gonna look cool.
