Currently the the key-value data format uses nesting to keep data.

But many people find it hard to use nesting, that four spaces and avoiding tabs.

So, in future I will introduce another format along with this that will use curly braces:

field1: value 1
field2: {
    nested-field1:
        {
            more-nested: more nested value.
            nested-multiline~:{
                at least this multiline value should
                keep nesting to remove all those preceding whitespaces.
                But if anyone do not want to have the luxury of removing the whitespace they can do the following.
            }
            no-whitespace-rm-luxury~:{!
no space precedes
                a lot of whitespaces out there behind me.
            }
            or-such~:
            {!
your dirty multiline value
                and these preceding whitespaces are not going to go anywhere in the recycle bin.
            }
        }
}
